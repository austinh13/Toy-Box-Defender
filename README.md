Project aimed at creating a function 2D Tower Defense Game with animations, game mechanics, and user interface. 

Only used Java and was able to create the game using Java Graphics, Swing, and OOP. 

To run on any PC download ToyboxDefender.jar and make sure you have java installed.

Enemies per wave can be changed from the .txt file along with images.

Project was primarily developed by me with assistance from two other members on creating images and icons.
